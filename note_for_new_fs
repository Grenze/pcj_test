1.for nvm, every param type of File or Path should:
    a.first convert to File.getCanonicalPath()[unique for ObjectDirectory]
    b.second convert to String to identify file or directory[global id]

2.for every file or directory, it should keep its parent directory's global id(String)
    and its local name(String) to form its global id(String) to be recognized
    by ObjectDirectory

3.for every directory, it should also keep its sub's local name(String) in its List<String>
    to index them

4.no idea about the actual type before you get the file or directory out of ObjectDirectory
    so implement the same base class with boolean isFile, isDirectory
